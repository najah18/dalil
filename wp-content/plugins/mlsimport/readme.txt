MlsImport is an MLS Wordpress plugin that lets you download and synchronize real estate data from various MLSs (Multiple Listing Services). It works by calling  MLSimport API/your MLS API, reading the data from your Multiple Listing Association, and transforming it into a WordPress-like format. You will need a valid access token from your MLS to use this plugin and an MLSImport account. Currently, the plugin only works for <a href="https://wpresidence.net/" target="_blank">WPResidence</a>, Houzes, Real Homes, and <a href="https://wpestate.org/" target="_blank">WpEstate Wordpress Themes</a>.
